# Spinning Donut in Rust

This project is a simple implementation of a spinning donut animation written in Rust. It demonstrates basic concepts of graphics rendering and animation in a terminal environment.

## Features

- ASCII art rendering of a spinning donut
- Smooth animation in the terminal
- Adjustable rotation speed

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Bridiro/spinning-donut.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd spinning-donut
    ```
3. Build the project:
    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

## Usage

Run the spinning donut animation with the following command:
```sh
cargo run --release
```

## Customization

You can adjust the rotation speed and other parameters by modifying the source code in `src/main.rs`.

## Acknowledgements
